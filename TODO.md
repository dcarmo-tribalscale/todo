# TODO

- [ ] Clean up concurrency warnings
- [ ] Add loading to home page when gathering Todos
- [ ] Pull to refresh on the Todos page
- [ ] Error handling to show messages on page
- [ ] Unify errors that come from Database so it's consistent and can be acted on
- [ ] Unify errors that come from the Auth framework so it's consistent and can be acted on
- [ ] Separate out the Auth and the Database using static frameworks instead of dynamic (this has proven to have it's challenges because we are using Firebase it's quite baked in and doesn't like it much)
- [ ] Clean up implementation for shortcuts to use a better storage method than a global variable
